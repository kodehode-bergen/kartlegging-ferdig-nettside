          Traditions wary wildly by country, and brands are important parts of
          traditions. In Norway, it is very common to eat Kvikk Lunsj (Quick
          Lunch), a chocholate similar to Kit-Kat, and drink a local
          orange-flavoured soda called Solo. Kvikk Lunsj is popular to bring on
          hikes and ski trips, and as those traditions are important in
          Norwegian easter, the chocholate sells really well in this period. The
          yellow color of Solo is also believed to be the reason of the brands
          insertion into the tradition.
